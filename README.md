# Rdxl Scaffolding

Prefabricated HTML components

```rust
xhtml!(<!ProgressBar numerator=12 denominator=32 unit="MB"/>)
```

This UI scaffolding is meant to abstract over many possible display logics. Whether it be a site redesign,
or an entirely separate platform, rdxl! is meant to provide only a thin logical abstraction rather than an
opinionated UI framework. The concept of "Minimal Common Abstraction" will be the unifying design concept
herewithin.
